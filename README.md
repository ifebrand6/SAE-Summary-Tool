# SAE-Summary-Tool
My solution to a take-home coding assignment. Itâ€™s a minimal full-stack app using Next.js (frontend) and Flask (backend) that parses .docx clinical trial files, extracts SAE tables, generates summary sentences, and lets you download the results as JSON. Focused on core logic, not production readiness.
